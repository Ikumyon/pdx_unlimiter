# What is this?

## Features

### Savegame management

Since keeping track of all your savegames is getting more complicated with every new savegame you start or backup you revert to,
the EU4 Unlimiter provides you with an easy to use interface for choosing the right save file.
This is done by collecting all savegames and creating a browsable savegame history so you can load any prior saved version of
that savegame.
This works for both Ironman and Non-Ironman savegames even though manual savegame management for ironman games by reverting to
backups is not intended and is therefore considered by some as savescumming.

### Loading time improvements

When using the EU4 Unlimiter for savegame management, you can also enable a feature which automatically removes all unnecessary
data from a savegame file.
This includes country histories, province histories, war histories and economic statistics of the ledger and should only be done
if you are not interested in these kinds of data.
This speeds up the loading time for an eu4 save by approximately (amount)%.
